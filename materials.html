            <h2>Recycled Cork Panels and Flooring</h2>
            <p>
              Ever consider how many wine corks we go through and whether there
              is a better place for them than the landfill? Guess what? There
              is. Companies like Jelinek Cork Group recycle your old wine
              stoppers (natural cork only) and turn them into a variety of
              items. Cork ReHarvest is a program that collects post-consumer
              corks from a variety of drop-off places and distributes them to
              firms such as Jelinek. Check out their stunning mosaic cork
              flooring or acoustic wall and ceiling panels. Wine enthusiasts
              around may now put their old corks to good use!

                <h2>Recycled Glass Tiles</h2>
                Local, recyclable, and VOC-free finishes? Yes, Fireclay Tile can provide you with the most stunning glass tile that will look great in your kitchen or bathroom (or wherever else), all while keeping sustainability in mind. They handmake their glass tiles in California using 100% locally recycled glass, primarily from the window and solar industries. Many of their color options are reminiscent of sea glass and are made using a VOC-free pigmentation method. Old windows and solar industry debris never looked better!

                <h2>Recycled Steel</h2>
                Did you know that every steel produced in North America has at least 28% recycled content? You may, however, build with much higher percentages of steel, and it will all be 100% recyclable at the end of its life (a feat that most building materials cannot duplicate). Even better, steel is pest-resistant and free of hazardous chemicals, both of which treated wood building materials cannot compete with! Look into steel prefab homes from firms like EcoSteel, or use recycled steel for framing, roofing, or structural elements in your sustainable home.

            <h2>AshCrete</h2>
            <p>
                Mix coal combustion ash with cement to make 'AshCrete,' a sustainable alternative. By substituting coal fly ash for Portland cement, we save cement resources and reduce landfill waste. Separation Technologies LLC's ProAsh increases the strength and durability of concrete while also qualifying for LEED credits. In response to safety concerns, the NRDC states that encapsulation technique prevents harmful elements from coal ash from seeping during construction, ensuring environmental safety even during demolition, because pulverization does not break it down below the molecular level.
